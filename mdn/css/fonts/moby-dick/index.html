            Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely–having little
            or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I
            thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It
            is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
            Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
            drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
            before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
            and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
            requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping
            into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off then, I account
            it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.
